# Crime Forecasting and Trend Analysis for Los Angeles


## Project Overview
This project is focused on analyzing crime patterns and forecasting future crime incidents in Los Angeles using advanced machine learning models. The goal is to provide actionable insights for law enforcement and policymakers to improve public safety by anticipating where and when crimes are likely to occur. The analysis includes both exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling, with the code deployed and run on AWS EC2 for scalability.

## Motivation
Crime prevention and resource optimization are critical for large urban areas. By predicting crime trends, this project aims to help law enforcement agencies proactively allocate resources to the areas that need it most. The insights generated are designed to support better strategic decision-making for policymakers and security departments.

## Target Audience
1. Law enforcement agencies seeking data-driven insights to allocate resources more efficiently.
2. Policymakers aiming to implement crime prevention strategies based on predicted crime trends.
3. Data science enthusiasts interested in machine learning applications for real-world problems.

## Key Features
1. Crime Trend Analysis:
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Los Angeles crime data, including demographic and geospatial factors.
   - Mapped crime incidents to visualize crime density and hotspots across the city.
2. Time Series Forecasting:
   - Used SARIMAX and Prophet models to predict future crime rates for 2024 and 2025.
   - Identified seasonal and trend patterns in the data to forecast high-risk time periods.
3. Cloud Deployment:
   - Deployed the model and ran the entire analysis pipeline on AWS EC2 to ensure scalability and performance.
   - Leveraged cloud computing for processing large datasets efficiently.

## Technologies & Tools
1. Programming Languages & Libraries:
   - Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly).
   - Statsmodels for SARIMAX model.
   - Facebook Prophet for time series forecasting.
2. Data Processing & Analysis:
   - Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering.
   - One-hot encoding, Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
3. Cloud Platform:
   - AWS EC2 for running the predictive models and data processing pipeline.
4. Visualization:
   - Plotly for interactive, web-based visualizations.
   - Matplotlib and Seaborn for statistical and geographical analysis.
