# Crime Forecasting and Trend Analysis for Los Angeles


## Project Overview
This project is focused on analyzing crime patterns and forecasting future crime incidents in Los Angeles using advanced machine learning models. The goal is to provide actionable insights for law enforcement and policymakers to improve public safety by anticipating where and when crimes are likely to occur. The analysis includes both exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling, with the code deployed and run on AWS EC2 for scalability.

## Motivation
Crime prevention and resource optimization are critical for large urban areas. By predicting crime trends, this project aims to help law enforcement agencies proactively allocate resources to the areas that need it most. The insights generated are designed to support better strategic decision-making for policymakers and security departments.

## Target Audience
1. Law enforcement agencies seeking data-driven insights to allocate resources more efficiently.
2. Policymakers aiming to implement crime prevention strategies based on predicted crime trends.
3. Data science enthusiasts interested in machine learning applications for real-world problems.
